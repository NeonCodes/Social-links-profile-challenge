## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
I'm starting to get more comfortable with flexbox and the box model.



### Continued development

I would be curious to try CSS grid next time. And get a better understanding of media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-button-link-code-examples-how-to-make-html-hyperlinks-using-the-href-attribute-on-tags/) - This helped me figure out buttons with links. 
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/) -Detailed article on links and buttons but only ended up reading the beginning: It talks about Javascript too and I haven't learned that yet. Bookmark for later.
