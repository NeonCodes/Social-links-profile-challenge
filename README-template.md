## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned
I'm starting to get more comfortable with flexbox and the box model. I also learned to style buttons.



### Continued development

I would be curious to try CSS grid next time. And get a better understanding of media queries.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-button-link-code-examples-how-to-make-html-hyperlinks-using-the-href-attribute-on-tags/) - This helped me figure out buttons with links. 
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/) -Detailed article on links and buttons but only ended up reading the beginning: It talks about Javascript too and I haven't learned that yet. Bookmark for later.
